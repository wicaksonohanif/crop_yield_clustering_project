# 🌾 Crop Yield Analysis and Clustering Dashboard using K-Means

![Alt Text](assets/thumbnail_linreg.png)

## 🔎 About
This project focuses on the analysis and clustering of crop harvest results across several regions using the K-Means algorithm. The clustering is based on key environmental factors, particularly average rainfall and temperature, to better understand the influence of internal and external conditions on agricultural outcomes.
